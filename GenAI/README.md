Generative AI Projects

Welcome to my repository dedicated to the exciting world of Generative AI!

## About This Repo

This is my personal playground for exploring and implementing various concepts and applications related to **Generative AI**. Here, I'll be uploading code, projects, and experiments as I learn and build with different GenAI models and technologies.

The main goal is to document my journey and share my work with the community.

## What You'll Find Inside

You can expect to find code and examples related to:

-   Large Language Models (LLMs)
-   Image and video generation
-   Fun experiments with various GenAI APIs
-   Fine-tuning models for specific tasks
-   And much more as I explore the field!

## Getting Started

Feel free to browse through the folders, clone the repository, and run the code. I hope you find the projects interesting and useful!
