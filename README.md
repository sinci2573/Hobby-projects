# Builds and Brews

Welcome to **Builds and Brews** — a curated collection of my software projects brewed with code, logic, and curiosity. This repository is my personal lab of learning, experimentation, and growth as a developer.

Whether it's machine learning, web development, data analysis, or automation, each project here reflects a concept I explored, a problem I solved, or a skill I sharpened.
