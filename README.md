# Builds and Brews

Welcome to **Builds and Brews** — a curated collection of my software projects brewed with code, logic, and curiosity. This repository is my personal lab of learning, experimentation, and growth as a developer.

Whether it's machine learning, web development, data analysis, or automation, each project here reflects a concept I explored, a problem I solved, or a skill I sharpened.

## How This Repository is Structured

Each project is contained in its own subfolder or notebook. Inside, you’ll typically find:
- A brief explanation of the problem
- The solution approach
- Code (notebook or scripts)
- A mini README or documentation
- Dependencies if any

## Purpose

This repository serves as:
- A **portfolio** of my software development journey
- A **sandbox** to experiment with new ideas
- A **reference** for future learning and collaboration
